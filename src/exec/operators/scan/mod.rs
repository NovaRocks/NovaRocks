//! Scan operator module exports.

//! Responsibilities:
//! - Exposes scan source, runner, dispatch, and shared scan types used by pipeline scan execution.
//! - Provides the integration surface between scan planning and runtime scan workers.
//!
//! Current limitations:
//! - Implements only the execution semantics currently wired by novarocks plan lowering and pipeline builder.
//! - Unsupported states should be surfaced as explicit runtime errors instead of fallback behavior.
