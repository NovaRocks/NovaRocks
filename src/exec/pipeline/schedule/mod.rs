//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! - Exposes event scheduler and observer utilities used by driver executors.
//! - Defines scheduling-related helper module boundaries.
//!
//! Current limitations:
//! - Implements only the execution semantics currently wired by novarocks plan lowering and pipeline builder.
//! - Unsupported states should be surfaced as explicit runtime errors instead of fallback behavior.
